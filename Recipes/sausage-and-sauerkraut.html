    <h1>Sausage and Sauerkraut</h1>

    <p><strong><h2>I can't think of another catching phrase!</h2></strong></p>
        <p>This sauerkraut and sausage recipe is from a sweet old German lady I used to attend church with.</p>
        <p>Allow for plenty of time to prepare and cook this dish. It is definitely worth</p> 
        <p>the time and effort! Serve with hot German potato salad and red cabbage.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2> 
     <ul>
        <li>2 pounds sauerkraut, rinsed and drained</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon caraway seeds (Optional)</li>
        <li>¼ cup brown sugar</li>
        <li>1 apple, diced</li>
        <li>½ pound bacon, cut into 1-inch pieces</li>
        <li>1 large onion, chopped</li>
        <li>1 ½ pounds kielbasa sausage, cut into 1-inch thick slices</li>
        <li>cooking spray</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Step by step</h2>
      <ol>
        <li><p>Place sauerkraut, caraway seeds, brown sugar, and apple into a large saucepan over medium-low heat,
            <p>and bring to a simmer. Reduce heat to low, and cook for 2 hours, stirring occasionally.</p></li>
        <li><p>Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish. Place bacon and 
            <p>onion into a skillet over medium heat, and cook until bacon is almost crisp and onion is beginning to 
            <p>brown, about 10 minutes. Stir the bacon mixture into the sauerkraut.</p></li>    
        <li><p>Brown kielbasa sausage in remaining bacon grease in the same skillet until sausage begins to brown, 
            <p>10 to 15 minutes; stir into the sauerkraut mixture.</p></li>
        <li><p>Spoon the sauerkraut and sausage mixture into the prepared baking dish. Bake in the preheated 
            <p>oven until bubbling, about 1 hour.</p></li>    
      </ol>
